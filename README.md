# Predictive Analytics 2018

This repository is meant for sharing lecture note, assignments and data for predictive analytics module in Big Data Analytics (LA) and Big Social Data Analytics (LA) course at Copenhagen Business School, Denmark.


Predictive Analytics module is divided into three module. Every module consists of a mixture of lectures and in-class assignment. Lecture exercises, and in-class assignments will be provided through Jupyter notebooks.



## Module 1: Probability and Statistics



In this module, we will cover mathematics foundation for predictive analytics. The objective is to develop data analytics skills through investigations of different ways to organize and represent data and describe and analyze variation in data. Probability helps predict the likelihood that an event will happen, whereas statistics helps us to make sense of data.



### Books:



Introduction to Statistical Learning (https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) and its big brother, The Elements of Statistical Learning (https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387848570), are quite seriously mathematical and conceptual book, which is in fact basis for lecture notes.



### Softwares:



We will use Python to learn statistical and probabilistic approaches for understanding, analyzing and gaining insights from data. Please download and install Anaconda (Python 3.7 version) as per your operating system. Its must for running in class assignment. Best place to start learning python is Google's Python Class.



### Logistics:


 Details on each module component will be hosted on public GitHub repository (https://github.com/pankajk/PredictiveAnalytics)
 

## Module 2: Regression Analysis



In this module, we will cover different types of linear/non-linear regression analysis with machine learning flavor. It is powerful  predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor). This technique is used for forecasting, time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables. The process of performing a regression allows us to confidently determine which factors matter most, which factors can be ignored, and how these factors influence each other.
